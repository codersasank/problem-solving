A shopkeeper has four unique items to sell. Each of these four items has a different price. He announces a bundle offer. If you pick 7 items(given a choice of these four items), you only need to pay seven times the bundle price. In such a scenario, what should be the bundle price so that the shopkeeper breaks even 90% of the time.
